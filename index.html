    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A non-linear, thematic dashboard SPA. The structure prioritizes user-led exploration over the report's linear format. It begins with a high-level overview ('At a Glance') with key stats and charts. It then introduces a new 'Historical Evolution' section for chronological context. It then dives into the core themes: the 'Spiritual Nexus' (using tabs to separate Hinduism and Buddhism for clarity, now including more sites), 'Cultural Tapestry' (using visual grids for festivals and food, plus new cultural insights and travel tips), and 'Development & Future' (using a mix of charts and interactive info cards, with enhanced infrastructure details). This segmented approach makes the dense information digestible and allows users to focus on topics of interest. The sticky navigation ensures easy movement between these thematic sections, enhancing usability. -->

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-amber-700 text-xl">Ancient Roots & Mythology</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Gaya Ji's history stretches back to antiquity, mentioned as "Gayapuri" in the epic *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata*. Its origins trace back to the Rigvedic Kikata kingdom. In Hindu epics, Lord Rama is said to have performed the *piṇḍadāna* (ancestral rites) here for his father, Dasharatha. Its name originates from the demon Gayasura, whose pious body, as per the Vayu Purana, transformed into the very rocky hills surrounding the city (Mangla-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila, and Brahmayoni) after Lord Vishnu subdued him. This mythological origin deeply embeds the city's spiritual significance into its geographical identity.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-amber-700 text-xl">Mauryan, Gupta & Pala Eras</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">The city flourished significantly under the **Mauryan Empire** (321–187 BCE), with Emperor Ashoka building the first temple at Bodh Gaya in the 3rd century BCE. During the **Mauryan** and **Gupta** periods (4th–5th centuries CE), Magadha (including Gaya) was a cultural center; King Bimbisara (6th c. BCE) patronized Buddhism and Jainism. By the early medieval era, Gaya Ji fell under **Pala** rule (8th–12th c.), during which the core structures of the Mahabodhi Temple were constructed, further solidifying its prominence as a dual Hindu-Buddhist pilgrimage site.</p>

                        <h3 class="font-bold text-amber-700 text-xl">Medieval to Modern Rule & Independence</h3>
                        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">In 1194, the Turkic general Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji sacked the region; Gaya Ji later came under the Delhi Sultanate and the **Mughal Empire**. The present-day main Vishnu shrine (Vishnupad Temple) was rebuilt by Ahilyabai Holkar in 1787. Following the 1764 Battle of Buxar, Gaya Ji fell to the British East India Company, becoming part of Bengal Presidency and then Bihar. The modern **Gaya district** was created on October 3, 1865. In the 20th century, Gaya Ji was active in the independence movement, hosting the **37th Congress session** (December 26-31, 1922) under C. R. Das, attended by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It is also the birthplace of prominent leaders like Anugrah Narayan Sinha and Satyendra Narayan Sinha.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Today, Bodh Gaya (part of the larger Gaya Ji region) is recognized as a **UNESCO World Heritage Site** since June 26, 2002, for its unparalleled Buddhist significance (Mahabodhi Temple Complex), which is the earliest brick-built Buddhist shrine still standing. After 1947, Gaya Ji grew as a pilgrimage and regional center. It was designated a Heritage City under India’s **HRIDAY (Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana)** scheme for urban development, affirming its cultural and historical importance and focusing on urban planning and conservation.</p>
